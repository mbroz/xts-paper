# XTS mode revisited: high hopes for key scopes?

This paper concisely summarizes the XTS block encryption mode for storage sector-based encryption applications and clarifies its limitations. In particular, we aim to provide a unified basis for much needed discussions about the newly introduced key scope change to the IEEE 1619 standard.
